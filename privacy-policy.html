  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 4, 2026</p>

  <p>
    Knight's Tour is a single-player puzzle game developed by The Foundry Society.
    This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Anonymous gameplay analytics.</strong> We use Google Firebase Analytics to
      understand how players use the app. This includes events such as which difficulty
      levels are played, whether a game was completed or restarted, and whether hints or
      undo were used. No names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable
      information are collected or transmitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advertising identifiers.</strong> The app displays ads served by Google
      AdMob. Google may collect your device's advertising identifier to serve relevant
      ads. This is handled entirely by Google's SDK and is subject to
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Local game data.</strong> Your game progress and settings (such as
      completed levels and sound preferences) are stored locally on your device.
      This data is never uploaded or shared.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Names, email addresses, or any personal information</li>
    <li>Location or GPS data</li>
    <li>Contacts or call/message history</li>
    <li>Camera or microphone input</li>
    <li>Photos or files from your device</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
  <p>
    Anonymous gameplay analytics are used solely to improve the game — for example,
    to understand which difficulty levels are most popular and where players get stuck.
    We do not sell this data or use it for targeted advertising beyond what Google AdMob
    does automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> – anonymous usage analytics.
      See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Google AdMob</strong> – in-game advertising.
      See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Gameplay analytics are retained according to Google Firebase's default retention
    period. Local game data remains on your device until you uninstall the app or
    clear its data.
  </p>

  <h2>Children Under 13</h2>
  <p>
    Knight's Tour is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
    any information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has
    provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
    on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the app after a change
    constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
  </p>
